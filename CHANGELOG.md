## [1.14.3-0.10.2.10] - 2019-08-05

## [1.14.3-0.10.0.4-SNAPSHOT] - 2019-08-03
### Changed

### Added
- Introduce tools and armors including horse armor.
- Added many json configurations for armor, tool material, item and blocks and world generator.

## [1.14.3-0.9.0.2-SNAPSHOT] - 2019-07-11
### Added
- Added base mod with easy creation of new resources.
- Added ores, nether ores, storage blocks, ingots, nuggets, dusts, plates, dense plates and rods.
- Added copper, tin, aluminum, silver and lead (will expand soon).
- Added configurable world generation of ores in the overworld and the nether.
- Block hardness and resistance values are also configurable.
- Use forge tags so other mods can use these resources.
- Add basic crafting and smelting recipes.
- Some things like the plates are not craftable. It's expected that other mods implement these recipes with the tag system.
